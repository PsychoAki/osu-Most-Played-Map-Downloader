# osu-Most-Played-Map-Downloader
Download all of your played maps since the beggining of dawn wth this script ( ๑‾̀◡‾́)(‾̀◡‾́ ๑)


Im sick of downloading all of my maps one by one because of some stupid mistake like accidentally nuking the osu! folder or clicking the **DELETE ALL OF YOU BEATMAPS** in game
so i've created this, well sort of lmao 

How to Run ?

1.well.. this is python script so gotta make sure to download that thang boi
    go to chrome or better yet search it in microsoft store **if you have one**.. yea looking at ghost windows users
   
2.obviously download this script how else this this thing gonna run lmao, the name is **main.py** 
    when downloading this, put it in your most beloved folder AKA the folder you want to download the maps to, cause by default the maps will download on where the script is 

3.make sure to have this library installed **tqdm** this is for that sweet **real-time progress bar with MB/s speed display**
    to download, open terminal/powershell via admin then paste this command | "pip install tqdm"

4.open CMD locate the folder on where the script is then paste this command | "python main.py"
    then you're all set 

also make sure to remember what offset you've stopped - this is for continuing on where do you stopped the download is, **you do not want to download the whole thing do you?**
the default is 0 cause as i've said you want the whole thing downloaded. 

For example for 1st time use:
**How many beatmaps to download? (e.g. 100): 10
Start from offset? (0 for beginning): 1000**

the one to make sure to remember is how many beatmaps to download "10".
now to continue your download from 10 to 110.

**How many beatmaps to download? (e.g. 100): 100
Start from offset? (0 for beginning): 10**


yep that's it. now download all your lost maps and HAVE FUN!!!!!
